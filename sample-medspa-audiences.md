## Customer Personas

### Persona: Executive Emily

Emily is a 47-year-old marketing director at a tech company. She's married with two teenagers and lives in Westlake Hills. Between board meetings, travel, and shuttling kids to activities, she has limited time but values efficiency.

Emily started noticing deeper forehead lines and volume loss in her cheeks about two years ago. She's done her research—she follows several aesthetic providers on Instagram and has read countless reviews. She's cautious about trying new treatments and wants a provider who will be honest about what's realistic.

**Her goals:** Look refreshed for work video calls and in-person presentations. She has a milestone birthday coming up and wants to feel her best. Wants a provider who respects her time and doesn't push unnecessary treatments.

**Her hesitations:** Worried about looking overdone. Had a friend who got bad filler work and it made her nervous. Doesn't want her husband or coworkers to know she's getting treatments.

**How to reach her:** LinkedIn thought leadership content, referrals from her social circle, Google searches for "best Botox Austin" late at night after the kids are in bed.

### Persona: Self-Care Sarah

Sarah is 38, a pediatric nurse, and recently divorced. She's rediscovering herself after a difficult few years and is ready to invest in her own wellbeing. She lives in the Mueller neighborhood and values wellness, authenticity, and community.

Sarah is newer to aesthetic treatments—she's had a few facials but never tried injectables. She's curious but nervous. She spends time on TikTok and has seen videos demystifying Botox and filler, which has made her more open to trying them.

**Her goals:** Feel confident as she re-enters the dating scene. Treat the "11" lines between her brows that make her look angry. Establish a self-care routine that makes her feel pampered.

**Her hesitations:** Worried about pain. Unsure if she can afford ongoing treatments on a single income. Doesn't know what's right for her and needs guidance.

**How to reach her:** TikTok educational content, Instagram Reels showing real patient experiences, community events, and wellness partnerships.

### Persona: Maintenance Michael

Michael is 52, a successful real estate developer, and cares about his appearance more than he lets on. He works out regularly and eats well, but he's noticed his jawline isn't as defined as it used to be and he looks tired in photos.

His wife has been coming to aesthetic providers for years, and she finally convinced him to try it. He's skeptical but open. He wants a no-nonsense experience—quick appointments, minimal fuss, real results.

**His goals:** Look more energetic and competitive in a field where image matters. Tighten his jawline. Not look like he's "had work done."

**His hesitations:** Feels awkward in a spa environment. Worried other guys will judge him. Doesn't want to talk about it.

**How to reach him:** Referral from his wife. Discreet, professional messaging. Before/after photos of male patients. Early morning or lunch appointment availability.
